# Blog app

The Blog app will be a classic example of a blog website. You will create a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

```
Ruby
rails version 7.x gem package
```

### Setup

Open terminal and go to the folder you want to store the repo in:

```
# For example
cd Documents
```

Clone the repo and move to the folder with the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:akucintavalent/blog.git
cd blog
```

### Run Program

First, you need to install the required gems:

```
bundle install
```

Then you need to create a database:

```
rails db:create
```

Then you need to run migrations:

```
rails db:migrate
```

In order to start and checkout the app you should run in your terminal:

```
rails s
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
